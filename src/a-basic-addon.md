# A Basic Add-on

Add the following to `myaddon/__init__.py` in your add-ons folder:

```python
# import the main window object (mw) from aqt
from aqt import mw

# import all of the Qt GUI library
from aqt.qt import *

# import showInfo from Anki utilities
from aqt.utils import showInfo

# We're going to add a menu item below. First we want to create a function to
# be called when the menu item is activated.

def testFunction() -> None:
  # get the number of cards in the current collection, 
  # which is stored in the main window
  cardCount = mw.col.card_count()
  # show a message box
  showInfo("Card count: %d" % cardCount)

# create a new menu item, "test"
action = QAction("test", mw)
# set it to call testFunction when it's clicked
qconnect(action.triggered, testFunction)
# and add it to the tools menu
mw.form.menuTools.addAction(action)
```

Restart Anki, and you should find a 'test' item in the tools menu.
Running it will display a dialog with the card count.

If you make a mistake when entering in the plugin, Anki will show an
error message on startup indicating where the problem is.
